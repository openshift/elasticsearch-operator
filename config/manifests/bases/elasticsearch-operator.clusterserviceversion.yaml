      The Elasticsearch Operator for OCP provides a means for configuring and managing an Elasticsearch cluster for tracing and cluster logging.
      ## Prerequisites and Requirements
      ### Elasticsearch Operator Namespace
      The Elasticsearch Operator must be deployed to the global operator group namespace
      ### Memory Considerations
      Elasticsearch is a memory intensive application.  The initial
      set of OCP nodes may not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster.  Additional OCP nodes must be added
      to the OCP cluster if you desire to run with the recommended (or better) memory. Each ES node can operate with a
      lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.

  description: "The Elasticsearch Operator for OCP provides a means for configuring and managing an Elasticsearch cluster for use in tracing \nand cluster logging as well as a Kibana instance to connect to it.\nThis operator only supports OCP Cluster Logging and Jaeger.  It is tightly coupled to each and is not currently capable of\nbeing used as a general purpose manager of Elasticsearch clusters running on OCP.\n\nPlease note: For a general purpose Elasticsearch operator, please use Elastic's Elasticsearch (ECK) Operator [here](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/elastic/eck-operator/5fabf6d1ecb52450895164be?container-tabs=gti)\n\nIt is recommended that this operator be installed in the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace to \nproperly support the Cluster Logging and Jaeger use cases.\n\nOnce installed, the operator provides the following features for **Elasticsearch**:\n* **Create/Destroy**: Deploy an Elasticsearch cluster to the same namespace in which the elasticsearch CR is created.\n* **Update**: Changes to the elasticsearch CR will be scheduled and applied to the cluster in a controlled manner (most often as a rolling upgrade).\n* **Cluster health**: The operator will periodically poll the cluster to evaluate its current health (such as the number of active shards and if any cluster nodes have reached their storage watermark usage).\n* **Redeploys**: In the case where the provided secrets are updated, the Elasticsearch Operator will schedule and perform a full cluster restart.\n* **Index management**: The Elasticsearch Operator will create cronjobs to perform index management such as roll over and deletion.\n\nOnce installed, the operator provides the following features for **Kibana**:\n* **Create/Destroy**: Deploy a Kibana instance to the same namespace in which the kibana CR is created (this should be the same namespace as the elasticsearch CR).\n* **Update**: Changes to the kibana CR will be scheduled and applied to the cluster in a controlled manner.\n* **Redeploys**: In the case where the provided secrets are updated, the Elasticsearch Operator will perform a restart.\n\n### Additionally provided features\n* Out of the box multitenancy that is integrated with OCP user access control.\n* Document Level Security\n* mTLS communication between Elasticsearch, Kibana, Index Management cronjobs, and CLO's Fluentd\n* OCP prometheus dashboard for Elasticsearch clusters\n* Prometheus Alerting rules  \n"
